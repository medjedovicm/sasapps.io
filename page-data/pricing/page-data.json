Where the app is under the control of the SAS Apps team, built with SASjs, we are able to offer our most competitive rates (Plan A).</p>\n<p>The price is “per customer”, not “per app” - so if a customer has three apps, only one plan is needed.  The level is based on the status of the “trickiest to support” app - so if one of those is an in-house, non SASjs app then “Plan C” support would be offered.</p>\n<p>Details of the support plan (SLAs etc) are available <a href=\"/support\">here</a>.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Plan</th>\n<th>App Source</th>\n<th>SASjs</th>\n<th>Annual EUR</th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>A</td>\n<td>SAS Apps</td>\n<td>✅</td>\n<td>5k</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>B</td>\n<td>Customer</td>\n<td>✅</td>\n<td>10k</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>C</td>\n<td>Customer</td>\n<td>❌</td>\n<td>15k</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<ul>\n<li>Plan A:  App was built by the SAS Apps team, and SAS Apps maintains the source code</li>\n<li>Plan B:  App was built by the SAS Apps team, the Customer maintains the source code</li>\n<li>Plan C:  Non SASjs apps</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For customers with any of these plans, a 10% discount is available for Consultant / Developer days.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Pricing","description":"Developer Rates and Support Plans as provided by the SAS Apps team"}}},"pageContext":{}}}
