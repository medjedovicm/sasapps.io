Data Controller for SAS is an enterprise data governance and data workflow solution, maintained by Analytium Group, - specialists in analytics and data-driven app development.

Analytium customers can now take advantage of the productive and trusted Azure cloud platform, with streamlined deployments and management.

With data arriving from all directions in a fast -moving business environment, it's not always practical (or possible) to build automated, real -time processes for loading data into secure SAS environments. Data Controller for SAS enables business users in regulated cloud environments to self-serve their data uploads, and make safe and controlled updates to target tables with full data quality, approval step, and audit trail along the way.

Data Controller for SAS® has a web- based interface that allows nominated data owners to review all manual changes to data before they are applied, to maintain their data dictionary, and to set up data alerts and workflows. Other features include:
• Data cCatalog
• Data lLineage
• Data aAlerts
• DDL eExport
• Data qQuality rRules
• Excel / CSV uploads

Data Controller leverages the access engines of SAS to provide native engine support, such as MicrosoftMS SQL Server, as well as regular SAS datasets and SAS Viya in-memory CAS Tables.

By running Data Controller for SAS® on Azure, it is easier for users to get started and deploy due to the power of the combined technologies providing even greater flexibility and scalability.

"We are excited to be both a SAS and a Microsoft partner and to help business users self-manage their cloud -based reference data," stated Allan Bowe, Head of SAS Apps at Analytium.

"Through Microsoft Azure Marketplace, customers around the world can easily find, buy, and deploy partner solutions they can trust, all certified and optimized to run on Azure," said Sajan Parihar, Senior Director, Microsoft Azure Platform at Microsoft Corp. "We're happy to welcome Analytium Group's solution to the growing Azure Marketplace ecosystem."
